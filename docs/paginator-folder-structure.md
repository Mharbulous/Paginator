## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the planned directory and file structure for the Paginator MVP project. The structure is designed to be logical, easy to navigate, and promote a clear separation of concerns. This organization will aid in development, maintenance, and comprehension by any contributor, including AI agents assisting with development.


## 2. Top-Level Directory Structure
The project root directory, tentatively named `paginator-mvp/`, will contain the following main files and directories:

```tree
paginator-mvp/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── assets/
├── docs/
└── src/
```

* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
* **`README.md`**: The primary starting point for understanding the project, including setup instructions, project overview, and links to further documentation.
* **`assets/`**: Contains static assets used by the demonstration file or PoC, such as images or global CSS.
* **`docs/`**: Contains all project documentation, including requirements, architectural design, technical specifications, and this project structure document.
* **`src/`**: Contains all source code for the Paginator component, the demonstration file, and the BC Form 22 Proof-of-Concept.

## 3. assets/ Directory Structure
The `assets/` directory will store static files.

```tree
assets/
├── images/
│   └── placeholder.png       # Example placeholder, actual images as needed
└── css/
    └── global.css            # Optional: For any global styles shared by demo/PoC
```

* **`assets/images/`**: For raster (PNG, JPG) or vector (SVG) images used in `demonstration.html` or the PoC.
* **`assets/css/`**: For any global CSS files (e.g., resets, utility classes) that might be shared across different HTML files. This is optional and depends on styling needs.

## 4. docs/ Directory Structure
The `docs/` directory houses all project documentation.

```tree
docs/
├── paginator-project-brief.md
├── paginator-prd.md
├── epics/
│   ├── epic-001-paginator-engine.md
│   ├── epic-002-demonstration-file.md
│   └── epic-003-bc-form-22-poc.md
├── paginator-architecture.md
├── paginator-tech-stack.md
├── paginator-folder-structure.md  # This document
├── coding-standards.md
├── paginator-api-reference.md
├── paginator-data-models.md
├── paginator-environment-vars.md
├── paginator-testing-strategy.md
└── templates/
    └── architect-checklist.md
```

* **`epics/`**: Subdirectory containing all epic definition files.

## 5. src/ Directory Structure
The `src/` directory is the heart of the project's functionality, containing the Paginator component and its usage examples.

```tree
src/
├── paginator/
│   ├── paginator.js       # Core Paginator component JavaScript class/module
│   └── paginator.css      # Core Paginator component styles
│
├── demo/
│   ├── demonstration.html # The main demonstration and embedded documentation file
│   ├── demo-styles.css    # Optional: CSS specific to demonstration.html aesthetics
│   └── demo-script.js     # Optional: JS for interactive elements in demonstration.html
│
└── poc-bc-form-22/
    ├── bc-form-22.html    # The BC Form 22 PoC HTML file
    ├── form-styles.css    # Optional: CSS specific to the PoC aesthetics/layout
    └── form-script.js     # Optional: JS for interactive elements within the PoC
```

* **`src/paginator/`**: Encapsulates the core Paginator component.
  * **`paginator.js`**: The Vanilla JavaScript file containing the Paginator class and its logic.
  * **`paginator.css`**: The CSS file providing all necessary styles for the Paginator component to function and render correctly.

* **`src/demo/`**: Contains the interactive `demonstration.html` file, which serves as both a testbed and the primary developer documentation for using the Paginator.
  * **`demonstration.html`**: The HTML file that uses and explains the Paginator.
  * **`demo-styles.css`** (Optional): If `demonstration.html` requires specific styling beyond `paginator.css` and global styles for its presentation.
  * **`demo-script.js`** (Optional): If `demonstration.html`'s interactive examples require JavaScript logic separate from the Paginator component itself.

* **`src/poc-bc-form-22/`**: Contains the files for the BC Form 22 Proof-of-Concept.
  * **`bc-form-22.html`**: The HTML structure for the PoC, utilizing the Paginator component.
  * **`form-styles.css`** (Optional): For any specific styling required for the BC Form 22 representation that isn't part of the core Paginator or global styles.
  * **`form-script.js`** (Optional): For any JavaScript needed to power the interactive elements within the PoC (e.g., adding/removing items to demonstrate dynamic pagination).

## 6. Rationale for AI Agent Optimization
This project structure is designed to be easily parsable and navigable by AI agents:

* **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Code (`src`), documentation (`docs`), and static files (`assets`) are in distinct top-level directories.
* **Modularity**: The core paginator component is isolated in its own subdirectory within `src/`.
* **Descriptive Naming**: Directory and file names clearly indicate their purpose.
* **Predictable Paths**: Key files like the Paginator's JavaScript (`src/paginator/paginator.js`) and CSS (`src/paginator/paginator.css`) have straightforward, predictable paths.
* **Self-Contained Examples**: The `demo` and `poc-bc-form-22` directories group all necessary files for each example, making them easy to understand and run independently.

This structure should facilitate tasks such as code generation, analysis, and modification by AI agents working on the project.
