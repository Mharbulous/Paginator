## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the directory and file structure for the Paginator MVP project. The structure is designed to be logical, easy to navigate, and promote a clear separation of concerns. This organization will aid in development, maintenance, and comprehension by any contributor, including AI agents assisting with development.


## 2. Top-Level Directory Structure
The project root directory contains the following main files and directories:

```tree
Paginator/
├── .gitmodules
├── bmad-agent/
├── docs/
└── src/
```

`.gitmodules`: Configuration file for Git submodules.

`bmad-agent/`: Contains BMAD agent configuration, personas, tasks, templates and other resources used by the AI workflow.

`docs/`: Contains all project documentation, including requirements, architectural design, technical specifications, and this project structure document.

`src/`: Contains source code for the Paginator component and the demonstration files.


3. bmad-agent/ Directory Structure
The bmad-agent/ directory stores BMAD agent configuration and resources.

bmad-agent/
├── ide-bmad-orchestrator-cfg.md
├── ide-bmad-orchestrator.md
├── web-bmad-orchestrator-agent-cfg.md
├── web-bmad-orchestrator-agent.md
├── checklists/
├── data/
├── personas/
├── tasks/
└── templates/

bmad-agent/checklists/: Contains various checklists used in the development process.

bmad-agent/data/: Contains knowledge base and technical preferences data.

bmad-agent/personas/: Contains definitions for different agent personas.

**bmad-agent/tasks/*.

bmad-agent/templates/: Contains document templates used by the agent personas.


4. docs/ Directory Structure
The docs/ directory houses all project documentation.

docs/
├── Project Brief.md
├── prd.md
├── epics/
│   ├── epic-001-paginator-engine.md
│   ├── epic-002-demonstration-file.md
│   └── epic-003-bc-form-22-poc.md
├── stories/
│   ├── 1.1.story.md
│   └── 1.2.story.md
├── paginator-architecture.md

├── paginator-folder-structure.md  # This document
├── coding-standards.md
├── paginator-api-reference.md
├── paginator-data-models.md
├── paginator-environment-vars.md
├── paginator-testing-strategy.md
└── tutorial.md

Project Brief.md: Project brief document outlining the project's goals, scope, and requirements.

prd.md: Product requirements document detailing the product's specifications.

epics/: Subdirectory containing all epic definition files.

stories/: Subdirectory containing user story definitions.

tutorial.md: Tutorial documentation for using the paginator component.


5. src/ Directory Structure
The src/ directory is the heart of the project's functionality, containing the Paginator component and its usage examples.

src/
├── paginator/
│   ├── paginator.css
│   ├── paginator.js
│   ├── base.css
│   ├── console.css
│   ├── ink.css
│   ├── paper.css
│   ├── print-only.css
│   ├── print.css
│   └── screen-only.css
└── demo/
    ├── demonstration.html # The main demonstration and embedded documentation file
    └── page-size-control-panel.js     # JS for interactive elements in demonstration.html

src/paginator/: Encapsulates the core Paginator component.

paginator.css: The CSS file providing all necessary styles for the Paginator component to function and render correctly.

paginator.js: The JavaScript file containing the core Paginator logic.

src/demo/: Contains the interactive demonstration.html file, which serves as both a testbed and the primary developer documentation for using the Paginator.

demonstration.html: The HTML file that uses and explains the Paginator.

page-size-control-panel.js: JavaScript for interactive elements in the demonstration file.


6. Planned Future Structure
The following components are planned for future development:

src/
└── poc-bc-form-22/
    ├── bc-form-22.html    # The BC Form 22 PoC HTML file
    ├── form-styles.css    # CSS for the PoC aesthetics/layout
    └── form-script.js     # JS for interactive elements within the PoC

src/poc-bc-form-22/: Will contain the files for the BC Form 22 Proof-of-Concept.

bc-form-22.html: The HTML structure for the PoC, utilizing the Paginator component.

form-styles.css: For any specific styling required for the BC Form 22 representation.

form-script.js: For any JavaScript needed to power the interactive elements within the PoC.


7. Rationale for AI Agent Optimization
This project structure is designed to be easily parsable and navigable by AI agents:

Clear Separation of Concerns: Code (src), documentation (docs), and agent resources (bmad-agent) are in distinct top-level directories.

Modularity: The core paginator component is isolated in its own subdirectory within src/.

Descriptive Naming: Directory and file names clearly indicate their purpose.

Predictable Paths: Key files have straightforward, predictable paths.

Self-Contained Examples: The demo directory groups all necessary files for the example, making it easy to understand and run independently.

This structure should facilitate tasks such as code generation, analysis, and modification by AI agents working on the project.
