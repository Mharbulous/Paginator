## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the usage of **environment variables** for the **Paginator MVP component** and its development environment. **Environment variables** are *typically used to configure application behavior* across different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

---

## 2. Paginator Component Runtime

The **Paginator MVP** is a *purely client-side component*, consisting of **Vanilla JavaScript** (`` `paginator.js` ``) and **CSS** (`` `paginator.css` ``).

*   **No Runtime Environment Variables:** The **Paginator component** *itself **does not require or consume any environment variables*** to function in a web browser. Its behavior is configured through:
    *   JavaScript options passed to its constructor.
    *   `` `data-*` `` attributes on the HTML container element.
    *   CSS custom properties (variables) defined within its stylesheet or overridden by the user.

There are no API keys, backend URLs, or other external service configurations that need to be managed via **environment variables** for the **Paginator component** to operate.

---

## 3. Development and Build Environment

*   **No Build Process Variables:** The **Paginator MVP** is *designed to be used directly* without a separate build or transpilation step for its core files (`` `paginator.js` ``, `` `paginator.css` ``). Therefore, no build-time **environment variables** are applicable to the component itself.
*   **Local Development Server:** The local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension, as specified in `` `paginator-tech-stack.md` ``) does not require any custom **environment variables** to be set for this project.

## 4. Consuming Application Context

While the **Paginator component** itself does not use **environment variables**, an application that *integrates* or *consumes* the **Paginator component** might use **environment variables** for its own purposes (e.g., if it has a backend, a complex build system, or different deployment stages).

However, such **environment variables** would be *part of the consuming application's architecture* and would not be directly accessed or processed by the `` `paginator.js` `` or `` `paginator.css` `` files of this MVP.

---

## 5. Conclusion

For the **Paginator MVP**, *no specific setup or management* of **environment variables** is necessary for either its runtime operation or its development.
