# Product Requirements Document: Paginator Component MVP
*(Revised May 17, 2025)*

---

## 1. Introduction
Paginator is a novel front-end component designed to simplify the development of web applications that require a skeuomorphic "digital paper" interface, particularly for legal document preparation. It enables developers to create web pages that visually and functionally mimic standard 8.5x11 inch paper, complete with defined page-insets and content flow across multiple pages. The Paginator component is primarily CSS class-driven, with Vanilla JavaScript handling the underlying real-time WYSIWYG pagination engine.

This MVP focuses on delivering:

- The core Paginator component.
- A comprehensive HTML demonstration file (`demonstration.html`) that is dynamic and interactive. This file will serve as both the primary testbed for Paginator development and its primary developer documentation, with its textual content explaining how Paginator works.
- An interactive proof-of-concept (PoC) "showcase" rendering parts of an actual court form (BC Form 22) to validate its real-world applicability and dynamic response to content changes.

---

## 2. Goals
- **G1:** Develop a reusable front-end component (Paginator) that renders HTML content onto a series of skeuomorphic "digital paper" pages (8.5x11 inches with standard page-insets) and dynamically adjusts pagination in real-time to content changes.
- **G2:** Implement the Paginator using Vanilla JavaScript and a CSS class-driven approach for ease of integration and to avoid external dependencies.
- **G3:** Create a comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive HTML demonstration file (`demonstration.html`) that:
    - Serves as the primary evolving testbed for Paginator features.
    - Showcases Paginator's dynamic pagination engine reacting to real-time content changes.
    - Acts as the primary developer documentation, with its textual content being instructional material about Paginator.
- **G4:** Validate the Paginator's functionality and dynamic rendering accuracy by using it to create an interactive, client-side showcase of the BC Form 22 court document. This showcase will demonstrate Paginator's dynamic response to content changes in selected sections of a real-world form.
- **G5:** Provide developers with a tool that significantly reduces the time and complexity of building WYSIWYG, dynamically paginated web interfaces, especially for applications mimicking paper forms.
- **G6:** Ensure high fidelity between the on-screen rendered output and the printed output (`@media print`), reflecting the dynamic state of the content.
- **G7:** Deliver the MVP (Paginator component, dynamic/interactive demo file, interactive PoC showcase) within a firm 4-week timeline.

## 3. Target Audience
**Paginator Component Developers/Integrators:**
- Initially, the Project Owner (Brahm Dorst), a lawyer with development experience. The component must be easy for him to integrate into web applications.
- Future developers building applications requiring precise print-like layouts with dynamic content.

**End-Users of Applications Built with Paginator:**
- Legal professionals (e.g., "Kiana Abouzia," Legal Assistant persona) who require intuitive, WYSIWYG tools for rapid and accurate form generation, expecting digital interfaces to closely mirror paper forms and respond fluidly to their input.

## 4. Scope (MVP)

### 4.1. In Scope
- **IS1: Paginator Core Component:** (No change from previous version)
    - Vanilla JavaScript module for pagination logic.
    - Automatic initialization based on the presence of specific CSS classes.
    - CSS system for defining page structure (simulating 8.5x11 inch paper with configurable page-insets via CSS).
    - Implementation of a three-layer architecture: Paper Layer, Ink Layer, Console Layer.
- **IS2: Pagination Engine Logic:** (No change from previous version)
    - Accurate calculation of content height within page boundaries.
    - Detection of content overflow to trigger new page creation.
    - Insertion of necessary spacing elements.
    - Handling of breakable and unbreakable elements.
    - Real-time recalculation of layout and page breaks in response to DOM changes within designated content areas.
- **IS3: CSS Class System:** (No change from previous version)
    - A comprehensive set of CSS classes for developers to control layout, page breaks, element positioning within layers, and other Paginator features.
- **IS4: HTML Demonstration File (`demonstration.html` - Dynamic Testbed & Documentation):**
    - A single HTML file that comprehensively explains how to use the Paginator component.
    - This file will itself use the Paginator component for its own layout, serving as a live demonstration.
    - This file will act as the primary (and sole for MVP) developer documentation; its textual content will be instructional material about Paginator's functionality and usage.
    - Must include JavaScript-driven interactive controls (e.g., buttons to add/remove content, expand text areas) across 2-3 distinct examples to demonstrate Paginator's dynamic recalculation of page breaks and total pages in real-time. These interactive sections will also serve as test cases during development.
    - Will be developed early and incrementally as the Paginator component's features are built and tested.
- **IS5: BC Form 22 Proof-of-Concept (PoC) - Interactive Showcase:**
    - An interactive, client-side HTML representation of the BC Form 22 court document.
    - This PoC will be structured using HTML and styled using the Paginator component.
    - Interactivity will be focused on 1-2 key sections of the form (e.g., a schedule where items can be added/removed, an expandable notes section). This interactivity will allow for dynamic data entry or content manipulation to demonstrate Paginator's real-time adjustments to layout and pagination in a complex, real-world form structure.
    - The primary goal is to validate and showcase Paginator's dynamic engine, not to create a fully functional data entry application for the entire Form 22.
- **IS6: Cross-Browser Compatibility:** (No change from previous version)
    - Latest versions of: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Brave Browser (on desktop).
- **IS7: Print Styling (`@media print`):** (No change from previous version)
    - Dedicated print stylesheets to ensure clean print output that accurately reflects the current dynamic state of the on-screen WYSIWYG representation.

### 4.2. Out of Scope for MVP
- **OOS1:** Full interactive data entry, data validation, or data saving functionality for the entirety of the BC Form 22 PoC. Interactivity is limited to selected sections for demonstrating Paginator's dynamic capabilities.
- **OOS2:** Automatic scaling or resizing of content (e.g., images, tables) that is too large to fit on a page or in remaining page space. Such content will "degrade."
- **OOS3:** Explicit error messages, pop-ups, or console warnings from the Paginator component for malformed HTML structure or incorrect CSS class usage by the developer.
- **OOS4:** Any backend components or server-side logic.
- **OOS5:** Support for responsive design adapting to different screen sizes (desktop-only focus for MVP).
- **OOS6:** Support for mobile or tablet devices.
- **OOS7:** Advanced accessibility features beyond basic semantic HTML.
- **OOS8:** Complex UI for the "Console Layer" beyond basic positioning capabilities needed for the demo and PoC.
- **OOS9:** Support for page sizes other than 8.5x11 inches or different page orientations.
- **OOS10:** Bi-directional text support unless inherently supported by browser rendering.

## 11. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
*(No change from previous version)*

---

## 12. Initial Architect Prompt
*(Largely no change, but with added emphasis on dynamic aspects)*

The primary goal for the Architect is to create a technical design for the Paginator MVP based on this revised PRD. Key areas to address include:

... (points 1-3 from previous PRD)

**Component Architecture (Vanilla JS):**
- How will the Paginator's JavaScript monitor for DOM changes in designated content areas to trigger real-time updates? (e.g., MutationObserver).

... (points on CSS Architecture, Pagination Engine Design)

**Pagination Engine Design:**
- How will the engine efficiently recalculate layout upon dynamic content changes?

... (points on Print Fidelity, Three-Layer Interaction, Data Structures, Risk Assessment)

The technical design should be sufficiently detailed to allow a developer (initially Brahm Dorst) to implement the Paginator component and the interactive elements of the demonstration file and PoC.
