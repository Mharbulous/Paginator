## 1. Introduction

This document describes the **testing strategy** for the **Paginator MVP**. The primary goal of this strategy is to ensure the **Paginator component**, the `` `demonstration.html` `` file, and the `` `BC Form 22 PoC` `` (Proof-of-Concept) are *functional, reliable, and meet the specified requirements* within the project's timeline and resource constraints.

Given the *highly visual nature* of the **Paginator component** and the MVP's *rapid development cycle* with a solo developer, the strategy will emphasize **manual, visual, and interactive testing**.

---

## 2. Overall Philosophy

*   **Manual and Visual Focus:** Testing will primarily be conducted manually, with a strong emphasis on visual verification of the paginated output and dynamic behaviors.
*   **Iterative Testing:** Testing will be an *ongoing activity* throughout the development lifecycle, not just a final phase. As features are developed, they will be interactively tested using the `` `demonstration.html` `` file.
*   **Use Case Driven:** Testing scenarios will be derived from user stories, functional requirements (FR), and acceptance criteria (AC) outlined in the Product Requirements Document (`` `paginator-prd.md` ``).
*   **`demonstration.html` as Primary Testbed:** The `` `demonstration.html` `` file is *central to the testing strategy*. It will be designed with interactive sections that serve as *live test cases* for various **Paginator** features, especially its *dynamic real-time update capabilities*.
*   **`BC Form 22 PoC` for Real-World Validation:** The PoC will be used to validate **Paginator's** functionality and accuracy in a *more complex, real-world form structure*.

---

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1. Functional Testing

*   **Objective:** Verify that all features of the **Paginator component** *work as specified* in the PRD and `` `paginator-architecture.md` ``.
*   **Areas to Test:**
    *   Core pagination logic: Correct content flow, page break insertion, and management of `` `.breakable` `` elements.
    *   Real-time dynamic updates: **Paginator's** response to JavaScript-driven content changes (additions, deletions, modifications) within the `` `demonstration.html` `` and PoC.
    *   Three-layer architecture: Correct rendering and interaction of Paper, Ink, and Console layers.
    *   CSS class system: Ensure applying **Paginator-defined** CSS classes to HTML produces the intended layout and behavior.
    *   API methods: Manual invocation and verification of `` `Paginator.updatePagination()` `` and `` `Paginator.destroy()` `` methods.
    *   Initialization: Correct auto-initialization (via `` `.paginator` `` class) and manual JavaScript instantiation.
    *   Error handling: Console warnings/errors for incorrect HTML setup (e.g., missing layers).

### 3.2. Visual Testing

*   **Objective:** Ensure the **Paginator** renders the skeuomorphic pages and content *correctly and consistently*.
*   **Areas to Test:**
    *   Accurate rendering of 8.5x11 inch simulated pages with specified page-insets.
    *   Visual appearance of page cards (`` `.pgntr-page-card` ``).
    *   Correct layout and styling of content within the ink layer.
    *   Correct positioning and appearance of any console layer elements (in demo/PoC).
    *   Visual integrity of pagination across different content types (paragraphs, tables, basic images as per MVP scope).
    *   Consistency of the visual gap between page cards.

### 3.3. Print Fidelity Testing

*   **Objective:** Verify that the on-screen WYSIWYG representation *accurately translates to printed output*.
*   **Areas to Test:**
    *   Comparison of on-screen paginated view with the browser's print preview and, where possible, actual physical printouts (or "Print to PDF").
    *   Correct hiding of screen-only elements (e.g., `` `.pgntr-page-break-spacer` ``, page card visuals, console layer).
    *   Correct display of any `` `.pgntr-print-only` `` elements.
    *   Accurate page breaks and content flow in the printed output.
    *   Verification of the <1% deviation target between on-screen and print pagination for typical content flows (as per `` `Project Brief.md` `` SMART objectives).

### 3.4. Cross-Browser Testing

*   **Objective:** Ensure *consistent functionality and appearance* across supported desktop browsers.
*   **Browsers (Latest Stable Versions):**
    *   Google Chrome
    *   Mozilla Firefox
    *   Apple Safari
    *   Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)
    *   Brave Browser
*   **Process:** Manually execute a core set of functional and visual test scenarios on each supported browser.

### 3.5. Usability Testing (Developer-Focused for MVP)

*   **Objective:** Validate the *ease of use for a developer* integrating and using the **Paginator component**.
*   **Process:**
    *   The primary developer (Brahm Dorst) will assess the *intuitiveness of the CSS class system* and the JavaScript API during the development of `` `demonstration.html` `` and the `` `BC Form 22 PoC` ``.
    *   Evaluate the *clarity and usefulness* of `` `demonstration.html` `` as the primary developer documentation.

### 3.6. Informal Performance Observation

*   **Objective:** Identify any *obvious performance issues or lag*.
*   **Process:** Observe the *responsiveness of the Paginator*, especially during real-time dynamic content updates in `` `demonstration.html` `` and the PoC (e.g., when adding many table rows). While formal performance benchmarks are out of scope for MVP, *significant sluggishness* should be noted and addressed if it impacts the user experience of dynamic updates.

## 4. Testing Environment & Tools

*   **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension.
*   **Browsers:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave on desktop operating systems.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:** For DOM inspection, JavaScript debugging, console output checking, and style inspection.
*   **Print Output:** Browser's "Print to PDF" functionality and, if available, a physical printer.
*   **Visual Comparison:** Side-by-side comparison of on-screen rendering and print previews.

---

## 5. Test Case Development

*   **Dedicated HTML Test Files (`Tests/` folder):** A new `Tests/` folder at the project root will contain a series of dedicated HTML files, each designed to test specific Paginator functionalities, edge cases, and content types. These files will serve as persistent, executable test cases for:
    *   **Functional Validation:** Testing core pagination logic with diverse content (e.g., `test-big-table.html` for large tables, `test-long-prose.html` for extensive text, files with images, lists, etc.).
    *   **Edge Case Scenarios:** Files specifically crafted to push the boundaries of pagination (e.g., content just fitting a page, content slightly overflowing, empty pages, very small content blocks).
    *   **Regression Testing:** These files will be run regularly to ensure that new features or changes do not break existing functionality.
    *   Each test file will link to `paginator.js` and `paginator.css` and contain the necessary HTML structure to instantiate the Paginator component.

*   **`demonstration.html` as Interactive Testbed:** The interactive sections within `` `demonstration.html` `` will continue to be used for *live, dynamic testing* during development. For example:
    *   A section for adding/removing list items to test basic reflow.
    *   A section for dynamically adding rows to a table that spans multiple pages.
    *   A section with an expandable/collapsible text area.
    *   Examples showcasing different `` `.breakable` `` scenarios.

*   **`BC Form 22 PoC` as Integration Test Case:** This will test **Paginator's** behavior with a *complex, nested HTML structure* representative of a real-world form.

*   **Checklist-Based Testing:** A checklist of features, requirements, and acceptance criteria from the PRD will be used to *guide manual testing sessions* and ensure coverage.

---

## 6. Defect Tracking

*   For the MVP, **defect tracking** will be *managed informally* by the primary developer (Brahm Dorst). This may involve a simple to-do list, personal notes, or issue tracking within a Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Issues) if one is used for the project.
*   Defects found will be prioritized based on their *impact on core functionality* and MVP goals.

---

## 7. Out of Scope for MVP Testing

The following testing types are out of scope for the **Paginator MVP** due to project timeline, resource constraints, and the highly visual nature of the component where manual/interactive testing provides *high value for effort*:

*   **Automated Unit Tests:** (e.g., using Vitest, Jest, Mocha). While valuable, the time investment for comprehensive unit testing of DOM-heavy visual logic is deferred post-MVP to meet the 4-week timeline.
*   **Automated End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** (e.g., using Selenium, Playwright, Cypress).
*   **Formal, SQA-led Performance and Load Testing.**
*   **Automated Visual Regression Testing.**

These may be considered for future enhancements and long-term maintenance of the **Paginator component**.

---

## 8. Test Exit Criteria (Informal for MVP)

The MVP testing will be *considered complete when*:

*   All functional requirements (FR) and acceptance criteria (AC) outlined in the PRD have been manually tested and verified as met through `` `demonstration.html` `` and the `` `BC Form 22 PoC` ``.
*   Print fidelity meets the <1% deviation target for typical content flows.
*   No critical or major blocking bugs are present in the core **Paginator** functionality on any of the supported browsers.
*   The `` `demonstration.html` `` file *effectively showcases and documents* all core **Paginator** features.
