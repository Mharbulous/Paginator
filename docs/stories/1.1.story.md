# Story 1.1: CSS Structure & Page Definition

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to apply CSS classes to define pages that simulate 8.5x11 inch paper with standard margins
- so that I can create skeuomorphic layouts.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CSS correctly defines page containers that visually simulate 8.5x11 inch paper.
2. Page containers have configurable margins via CSS variables.
3. The three-layer architecture (Paper, Ink, Console) is implemented via CSS classes.
4. Proper z-index management ensures correct layering of content.
5. Basic pointer-event management is implemented to ensure proper interaction with each layer.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2) Create the basic structure for paginator.css
  - [ ] Define CSS variables for page dimensions and margins
  - [ ] Implement styles for the main `.paginator` container
  - [ ] Create styles for the `.pgntr-page-card` that simulate 8.5x11 inch paper
  - [ ] Ensure page cards have configurable margins using CSS variables

- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3, 4, 5) Implement the three-layer architecture
  - [ ] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-paper-layer` for visual page representation
  - [ ] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-ink-layer` for content that flows across pages
  - [ ] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-console-layer` for UI controls
  - [ ] Set proper z-index values to ensure correct stacking order
  - [ ] Implement pointer-events management for proper user interaction

- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 1, 2, 3) Create `@media print` styles
  - [ ] Implement print styles that ensure pages print with correct dimensions
  - [ ] Configure print margins to match the on-screen representation
  - [ ] Define styles for the `.screen-only` and `.pgntr-print-only` classes

- [ ] Task 4 (AC: all) Create a basic test HTML file to verify CSS implementation
  - [ ] Create a minimal HTML structure with the required layers
  - [ ] Add sample content to test layer visibility and dimensions
  - [ ] Verify visual appearance matches design specifications

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Component Structure
The CSS implementation should follow the three-layer architecture as defined in the architecture document:
- **Paper Layer**: Visual representation of pages with correct dimensions
- **Ink Layer**: Contains actual document content that flows across pages
- **Console Layer**: For UI controls, non-printable, overlaid on other layers

### CSS Variables
Implement the following CSS variables at minimum:
- `--pgntr-page-width-visual`: Default 8.5in
- `--pgntr-page-height-visual`: Default 11in
- `--pgntr-page-margin`: Default 0.5in
- `--pgntr-page-gap`: Space between pages in the visual representation (default 30px)

These variables should be configurable either via JavaScript or through data attributes as specified in the API reference document.

### Required HTML Structure
The CSS should be designed to work with the following HTML structure:
```html
<div class="paginator">
  <div class="pgntr-paper-layer">
    <!-- Page cards will be generated here by JS -->
  </div>
  <div class="pgntr-ink-layer">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="pgntr-console-layer">
    <!-- UI controls go here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Z-Index and Pointer Events
- Paper Layer should have z-index: 1
- Ink Layer should have z-index: 2
- Console Layer should have z-index: 3

For pointer-events:
- Console layer should have `pointer-events: none` with direct children having `pointer-events: auto` to ensure only UI elements are interactive
- Ink Layer should have normal pointer events for content interaction
- Paper Layer should have appropriate pointer-events settings to avoid interfering with content interaction

### Responsive Considerations
While the MVP is desktop-only, ensure the CSS doesn't introduce issues when viewed on different desktop screen sizes.

### File Location
The CSS should be implemented in `src/paginator/paginator.css` as defined in the folder structure document.

### Reference to Technical Documentation
See `paginator-architecture.md#4.2-CSS-(`paginator.css`)` for detailed specifications on the CSS structure.
