# Story 1.1: CSS Structure & Page Definition

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to apply CSS classes to define pages that simulate 8.5x11 inch paper with standard margins
- so that I can create skeuomorphic layouts.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CSS correctly defines page containers that visually simulate 8.5x11 inch paper.
2. Page containers have configurable margins via CSS variables.
3. The three-layer architecture (Paper, Ink, Console) is implemented via CSS classes.
4. Proper z-index management ensures correct layering of content.
5. Basic pointer-event management is implemented to ensure proper interaction with each layer.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2) Create the basic structure for paginator.css
  - [x] Define CSS variables for page dimensions and margins
  - [x] Implement styles for the main `.paginator` container
  - [x] Create styles for the `.pgntr-page-card` that simulate 8.5x11 inch paper
  - [x] Ensure page cards have configurable margins using CSS variables

- [x] Task 2 (AC: 3, 4, 5) Implement the three-layer architecture
  - [x] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-paper-layer` for visual page representation
  - [x] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-ink-layer` for content that flows across pages
  - [x] Create CSS for the `.pgntr-console-layer` for UI controls
  - [x] Set proper z-index values to ensure correct stacking order
  - [x] Implement pointer-events management for proper user interaction

- [x] Task 3 (AC: 1, 2, 3) Create `@media print` styles
  - [x] Implement print styles that ensure pages print with correct dimensions
  - [x] Configure print margins to match the on-screen representation
  - [x] Define styles for the `.screen-only` and `.pgntr-print-only` classes

- [x] Task 4 (AC: all) Create a basic test HTML file to verify CSS implementation
  - [x] Create a minimal HTML structure with the required layers
  - [x] Add sample content to test layer visibility and dimensions
  - [x] Verify visual appearance matches design specifications (Manual check of demonstration.html)

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Component Structure
The CSS implementation should follow the three-layer architecture as defined in the architecture document:
- **Paper Layer**: Visual representation of pages with correct dimensions
- **Ink Layer**: Contains actual document content that flows across pages
- **Console Layer**: For UI controls, non-printable, overlaid on other layers

### CSS Variables
Implement the following CSS variables at minimum:
- `--pgntr-page-width-visual`: Default 8.5in
- `--pgntr-page-height-visual`: Default 11in
- `--pgntr-page-margin`: Default 0.5in
- `--pgntr-page-gap`: Space between pages in the visual representation (default 30px)

These variables should be configurable either via JavaScript or through data attributes as specified in the API reference document.

### Required HTML Structure
The CSS should be designed to work with the following HTML structure:
```html
<div class="paginator">
  <div class="pgntr-paper-layer">
    <!-- Page cards will be generated here by JS -->
  </div>
  <div class="pgntr-ink-layer">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="pgntr-console-layer">
    <!-- UI controls go here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Z-Index and Pointer Events
- Paper Layer should have z-index: 1
- Ink Layer should have z-index: 2
- Console Layer should have z-index: 3

For pointer-events:
- Console layer should have `pointer-events: none` with direct children having `pointer-events: auto` to ensure only UI elements are interactive
- Ink Layer should have normal pointer events for content interaction
- Paper Layer should have appropriate pointer-events settings to avoid interfering with content interaction

### Responsive Considerations
While the MVP is desktop-only, ensure the CSS doesn't introduce issues when viewed on different desktop screen sizes.

### File Location
The CSS should be implemented in `src/paginator/paginator.css` as defined in the folder structure document.

### Reference to Technical Documentation
See `paginator-architecture.md#4.2-CSS-(`paginator.css`)` for detailed specifications on the CSS structure.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List
- Created `src/paginator/paginator.css` with base styles, layer definitions, and print styles.
- Created `src/demo/demonstration.html` for manual visual verification of the CSS.
- All CSS variables specified in the story are defined.
- Z-index and pointer-events are implemented as per guidance.
- Print styles include `@page` rules and screen/print-only classes.
- The `demonstration.html` file includes sample content to test various aspects of the CSS.
- Manual verification of `demonstration.html` on screen and via print preview confirms visual appearance and layer behavior align with requirements.
- Revised `src/paginator/paginator.css` and `src/demo/demonstration.html` based on user feedback (2025-05-18): ensured paper layer is purely visual, ink layer contains all content and manages page margins. Manual re-verification of `demonstration.html` confirms revised visual appearance and layer behavior align with feedback and requirements.
- Further revised `src/paginator/paginator.css` and `src/demo/demonstration.html` based on user feedback (2025-05-18): enhanced realistic paper appearance and implemented a single document scrollbar. Manual re-verification of `demonstration.html` confirms these changes.
- Minor adjustment to `src/demo/demonstration.html` (2025-05-18): removed `.footer-notice` class from embedded styles and used inline styles for demo footer elements to clarify they are not part of the core component.
- Final adjustment to `src/demo/demonstration.html` (2025-05-18): removed extraneous `div` elements that were outside the `.paginator` structure, ensuring the demo strictly adheres to the three-layer concept for all Paginator-related visuals.
- Adjusted print styles in `src/paginator/paginator.css` (2025-05-18) to improve print margin handling after reviewing print preview feedback.

### Change Log
- `2025-05-18`: Created `src/paginator/paginator.css`
- `2025-05-18`: Created `src/demo/demonstration.html`
- `2025-05-18`: Revised `src/paginator/paginator.css` and `src/demo/demonstration.html` based on user feedback.

- `2025-05-18`: Minor update to `src/demo/demonstration.html` to inline demo-specific footer styles.
- `2025-05-18`: Final cleanup of `src/demo/demonstration.html` to remove non-Paginator-component divs.
