# Story 1.2:  User Story: Enhance Paginator Console with Interactive Controls and Dynamic Dimension Display

Status: Done

## 1. User Story

As a user, I want interactive controls in the Paginator's console layer, a dynamic display of page dimensions, current margin size, and browser information, so that I can visually adjust the size of the skeuomorphic pages, see their current dimensions and margin in real-time, and understand the browser context for calibration.

## 2. Description

The console layer in the `demonstration.html` file currently features static buttons ("Action 1", "Action 2") and text ("Console Controls"). This story will implement the following interactive features:

* **Icon Buttons:**
    * Replace the "Action 1" button with a "+" (plus) icon button.
    * Replace the "Action 2" button with a "-" (minus) icon button.
* **Dynamic Dimension Display:**
    * Replace the static text "Console Controls" with a dynamic display showing the current width and height of the skeuomorphic page elements (`.pgntr-page-card`) in pixels (e.g., "816.00px x 1056.00px"), always showing two decimal places. This display must update whenever the page dimensions change.
* **Dynamic Margin Display:**
    * Add a display for the current page margin (`--pgntr-page-margin`) in pixels (e.g., "margin: 48.00px"), always showing two decimal places. This display must update whenever the page margin changes.
* **Browser Information Display:**
    * Add a display for the current browser name and version (e.g., "Chrome 123.0").
* **Interactive Resizing Functionality (via JavaScript):**
    * **Increase Size ("+" button click):**
        * Increase the CSS variables `--pgntr-page-width-visual` and `--pgntr-page-height-visual` by 1% of their current values.
        * Increase the CSS variable `--pgntr-page-margin` by 1% of its current value.
    * **Decrease Size ("-" button click):**
        * Decrease the CSS variables `--pgntr-page-width-visual` and `--pgntr-page-height-visual` by 1% of their current values.
        * Decrease the CSS variable `--pgntr-page-margin` by 1% of its current value.
    * **Constraint:** Only the dimensions of the skeuomorphic pages (controlled by the specified CSS variables) and their margins should change. Font sizes, viewport size, or any other element sizes should remain unaffected by these actions.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1: Icon Button Replacement Successful:**
    * GIVEN the `demonstration.html` page is loaded
    * WHEN the console layer is inspected
    * THEN the "Action 1" button is replaced with a button displaying a "+" icon (or the text "+").
    * AND the "Action 2" button is replaced with a button displaying a "-" icon (or the text "-").

* **AC2: Dynamic Dimension and Margin Display Implementation:**
    * GIVEN the `demonstration.html` page is loaded

    * AND the display accurately reflects the initial computed width and height of the `.pgntr-page-card` elements, formatted to two decimal places.
    * AND the margin display format is "margin: MARGIN.XXpx" (e.g., "margin: 48.00px"), always showing two decimal places.
    * AND the margin display accurately reflects the initial computed value of `--pgntr-page-margin` (formatted to two decimal places).

* **AC3: Increase Size Functionality Correct:**
    * GIVEN the Paginator is displayed and the initial dimensions are noted.
    * WHEN the "+" icon button is clicked.
    * THEN the CSS variables `--pgntr-page-width-visual` and `--pgntr-page-height-visual` are increased by 1% of their values prior to the click.
    * AND the CSS variable `--pgntr-page-margin` is increased by 1% of its value prior to the click.
    * AND the visual representation of the `.pgntr-page-card` elements and their margins updates accordingly.

## 4. Tasks

1.  **Task 1: HTML Structure Update for Console:** - Complete
    * Modify `demonstration.html`.
    * Identify the existing "Action 1" and "Action 2" buttons and the "Console Controls" text element.
    * Replace "Action 1" button with `<button id="pgntrIncreaseSizeBtn" aria-label="Increase page size">+</button>`.
    * Replace "Action 2" button with `<button id="pgntrDecreaseSizeBtn" aria-label="Decrease page size">-</button>`.
    * Replace the "Console Controls" text element with `<span id="pgntrDimensionDisplay" aria-live="polite">Initial Dimensions</span>`.
    * Add `<span id="pgntrMarginDisplay" aria-live="polite" class="screen-only" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center; margin-top:2px; display: block;">Initial Margin</span>` below `#pgntrDimensionDisplay`.
    * Ensure new elements have appropriate IDs for JavaScript targeting.

2.  **Task 2: JavaScript for Initial Dimension and Margin Display:** - Complete
    * Create or update a relevant JavaScript file (e.g., `src/demo/demo-script.js`) and ensure it's linked in `demonstration.html`.
    * Implement/Modify a function `updateConsoleDisplays()` (renamed from `updateDimensionDisplay` for clarity):
        * Selects the first `.pgntr-page-card` element.
        * Gets its computed `width` and `height`.
        * Updates the text content of `#pgntrDimensionDisplay` to "WIDTH.XXpx x HEIGHT.XXpx", ensuring values are parsed as floats and formatted to two decimal places.
        * Gets the current value of the CSS variable `--pgntr-page-margin`.
        * Updates the text content of `#pgntrMarginDisplay` to "margin: MARGIN.XXpx", ensuring the value is parsed as a float and formatted to two decimal places.
    * Call `updateConsoleDisplays()` on page load (e.g., `DOMContentLoaded`) and after size changes.

3.  **Task 3: JavaScript for "+" Button (Increase Size):** - Complete
    * Add an event listener to `#pgntrIncreaseSizeBtn`.
    * On click:
        * Get the root element style declaration (e.g., `document.documentElement.style`).
        * Read the current string values of `--pgntr-page-width-visual`, `--pgntr-page-height-visual`, and `--pgntr-page-margin`.
        * Parse these values.
        * Calculate new values: `currentValue * 1.01`.
        * Set the new values using `setProperty`.
        * Call `updateConsoleDisplays()`.

4.  **Task 4: JavaScript for "-" Button (Decrease Size):** - Complete
    * Add an event listener to `#pgntrDecreaseSizeBtn`.
    * On click:
        * Similar to Task 3, read current CSS variable values.
        * Calculate new values: `currentValue * 0.99`.
        * Set the new values for the CSS variables.
        * Call `updateConsoleDisplays()`.

5.  **Task 5: CSS Variable Definition and Usage Check:** - Complete
    * Verify that `--pgntr-page-width-visual`, `--pgntr-page-height-visual`, and `--pgntr-page-margin` are defined in the CSS.
    * Ensure these variables are used to control the dimensions and margin of `.pgntr-page-card` elements and ink layer padding.

6.  **Task 6: Styling for New Console Elements (Optional but Recommended):** - Complete (Existing/inline styles sufficient)
    * Add/Update CSS to style console elements for a consistent and user-friendly look.
    * Ensure buttons are easily clickable and the displays are legible.

7.  **Task 7: Testing and Refinement:** - Complete (Pending User Verification)
    * Test all functionalities: button clicks, dimension/margin updates, display accuracy.
    * Verify constraint: only page/margin dimensions change.
    * Check for JavaScript errors. Ensure responsiveness.

8.  **Task 8: JavaScript and HTML for Browser Information Display:** - Complete
    * Modify `demonstration.html`: Add a new element (e.g., a `<span>` with id `pgntrBrowserInfoDisplay`) in the console controls area to show browser information.
    * Update `src/demo/demo-script.js`:
        * Implement a function `getBrowserInfo()` that attempts to identify the browser name and version from `navigator.userAgent`.
        * Implement a function `updateBrowserInfoDisplay()` that calls `getBrowserInfo()` and updates the text content of `#pgntrBrowserInfoDisplay`.
        * Call `updateBrowserInfoDisplay()` on page load.
    * Style the new display element for legibility if necessary.

## 5. Assumptions

* The CSS variables `--pgntr-page-width-visual`, `--pgntr-page-height-visual`, and `--pgntr-page-margin` are unitless numbers representing pixels.
* The structure of `demonstration.html` allows for straightforward replacement/addition of console elements.
* Basic JavaScript environment is set up.
* Using simple "+" and "-" text for buttons is acceptable. Aria-labels will be used.
* Browser detection via `navigator.userAgent` is sufficient.

## 6. Open Questions / Points for Clarification

* **Q1:** (Resolved) CSS variables are now unitless numbers representing pixels.
* **Q2:** (Resolved) Text content for buttons is sufficient.

## 7. Non-Goals

* Implementing more complex icon libraries.
* Changing Paginator aspects beyond specified console interactions (excluding newly added browser/margin info).
* Persisting size changes.
* Highly accurate browser detection.

## 8. Story Wrap Up

*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Implemented interactive console controls (+/- buttons) in `demonstration.html`.
    *   Added dynamic display for page dimensions (width x height), page margin, and browser information in the console.
    *   JavaScript logic for these features is in `src/demo/demo-script.js`.
    *   CSS variables (`--pgntr-page-width-visual`, `--pgntr-page-height-visual`, `--pgntr-page-margin`) in `src/paginator/paginator.css` were updated to be unitless pixel values.
    *   Print styles in `src/paginator/paginator.css` were adjusted to ensure consistent print output regardless of console adjustments (fixed `@page` margin, 100% width for ink layer).
    *   Console display values for dimensions and margin are formatted to two decimal places.
*   **Agent Model Used:** Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Developer Agent Persona)
*   **Changelog:**
    *   `src/demo/demonstration.html`: Modified console controls, added new display spans.
    *   `src/demo/demo-script.js`: Created and updated with logic for console controls, dimension/margin/browser display, and value formatting.
    *   `src/paginator/paginator.css`: Updated CSS variable definitions to be unitless; updated print styles for consistency.
    *   `docs/stories/1.2.story.md`: Updated throughout development with scope changes, task completion, and DoD.
*   **Notes for Next Story/Overall Project:**
    *   The console provides a good foundation for further interactive debugging or feature controls.
    *   The browser detection is basic and relies on `navigator.userAgent` parsing; more robust libraries could be considered if highly accurate detection becomes critical.
    *   The current implementation of resizing affects CSS variables directly. If more complex state management or undo/redo for these visual changes were needed, a more sophisticated approach would be required.
