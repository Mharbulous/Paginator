# Epic 2: `demonstration.html` - Dynamic Testbed & Documentation

* **ID:** EPIC-002
* **Title:** `demonstration.html` - Dynamic Testbed & Documentation
* **Project:** **Paginator** Component MVP
* **Date Created:** May 17, 2025
* **Last Updated:** May 17, 2025
* **Status:** Draft
* **Priority:** High
* **Related PRD:** `prd.md` (Revised May 17, 2025)

## 1. Goal
> Create a single, comprehensive HTML file (`demonstration.html`) that serves a dual purpose:
> 1.  As the primary, evolving **dynamic testbed** for all features of the **Paginator** component (developed in EPIC-001).
> 2.  As the primary **developer documentation**, containing instructional text and interactive examples explaining how to use **Paginator**.
> This file will itself use the **Paginator** for its own layout.

---

## 2. Scope & Features

### In Scope:
* **SF2.1: Base HTML Structure & Paginator Integration:**
    * Create `demonstration.html`.
    * Structure the overall layout of this file using the **Paginator** component itself (meta-demonstration).
* **SF2.2: Instructional Content (Embedded Documentation):**
    * Write clear, developer-focused text explaining **Paginator's** concepts (digital paper, **Paper**, **Ink**, **Console** layers, pagination engine).
    * Detail all public CSS classes, their purpose, expected behavior, and provide usage examples.
    * Explain how to structure HTML for use with **Paginator**.
    * This content will be integrated within the paginated layout of the demo file.
* **SF2.3: Static Demonstrations/Test Cases:**
    * Sections demonstrating the effect of **Paginator's** static layout CSS classes (e.g., page setup, layer assignment, classes that influence breaks like `page-break-before`).
    * These sections will serve as visual test cases for non-interactive features.
* **SF2.4: Interactive Dynamic Demonstrations/Test Cases (Minimum 2-3 distinct examples):**
    * Implement JavaScript-driven interactive controls that dynamically alter content within paginated areas to showcase **Paginator's** real-time update capabilities. Examples:
        * **Example A (List Manipulation):** Buttons to add/remove items from a list, with **Paginator** adjusting pages.
        * **Example B (Text Expansion):** A button or textarea to expand/contract a block of text, demonstrating reflow.
        * **Example C (Simple Table Manipulation):** Buttons to add/remove rows from a simple table within a paginated section.
    * These interactive sections will include necessary client-side JavaScript application logic (for the demo interaction itself, separate from **Paginator** core logic).
* **SF2.5: Print Styling Verification:**
    * Ensure all parts of the demo file, including interactive sections in their current state, print correctly via **Paginator's** print styles.

### Out of Scope (for this Epic):
* **OS2.1:** Development of the core **Paginator** engine itself (covered in EPIC-001).
* **OS2.2:** The BC Form 22 PoC (covered in EPIC-003).
* **OS2.3:** Complex application logic beyond what's needed for the specified interactive examples.

## 3. User Stories

**US2.1 (Developer - Brahm)**
:   As a developer building **Paginator**, I want to use `demonstration.html` as an evolving testbed to incrementally test each feature of the **Paginator** engine (both static and dynamic) as I develop it.

**US2.2 (Developer - using Paginator)**
:   As a developer learning to use **Paginator**, I want `demonstration.html` to clearly explain all its features, CSS classes, and usage patterns with examples, so I can understand how to integrate it.

**US2.3 (Developer - using Paginator)**
:   As a developer, I want to see interactive examples in `demonstration.html` that show **Paginator** dynamically recalculating layout and page count in real-time when content changes, so I can trust its capabilities.

**US2.4 (Developer - using Paginator)**
:   As a developer, I want the `demonstration.html` itself to be a showcase of **Paginator's** layout capabilities (using **Paginator** for its own structure).

**US2.5 (Developer - Brahm)**
:   As a developer building **Paginator**, I want the instructional text within `demonstration.html` to be the primary documentation, so I don't have to maintain separate documentation files for the MVP.

## 4. Technical Considerations

* The `demonstration.html` file will contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for its own interactive demo logic).
* The JS for demo interactivity should be kept distinct from the **Paginator** component's core JS.
* Needs to be developed in tandem with EPIC-001, serving as its test harness.
* Content must be clear, concise, and technically accurate.
* Interactive examples should be focused and effectively demonstrate the intended **Paginator** behavior.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

**AC2.1**
:   `demonstration.html` is created and its overall layout is managed by the **Paginator** component.

**AC2.2**
:   The file contains clear instructional text covering **Paginator** concepts, CSS classes, and usage examples.

**AC2.3**
:   Static demonstrations for **Paginator's** non-interactive features are present and accurately reflect component behavior.

**AC2.4**
:   At least 2-3 distinct, working interactive examples are implemented that allow dynamic content changes and clearly showcase **Paginator's** real-time pagination adjustments (page creation, deletion, content reflow).

**AC2.5**
:   All **Paginator** features, as developed in EPIC-001, are demonstrated or tested within this file.

**AC2.6**
:   The `demonstration.html` file prints correctly, reflecting its current on-screen dynamic state.

## 6. Dependencies
* PRD (`prd.md`)
* Heavily dependent on the ongoing development of EPIC-001 (**Paginator** Engine). It will evolve as Epic 1 progresses.
