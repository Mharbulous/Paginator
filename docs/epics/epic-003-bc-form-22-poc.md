# Epic 3: BC Form 22 PoC - Interactive Showcase

* **ID:** EPIC-003
* **Title:** BC Form 22 PoC - Interactive Showcase
* **Project:** **Paginator** Component MVP
* **Date Created:** May 17, 2025
* **Last Updated:** May 17, 2025
* **Status:** Draft
* **Priority:** Medium
* **Related PRD:** `prd.md` (Revised May 17, 2025)

## 1. Goal
> To validate and showcase the **Paginator** component's capabilities in a real-world context by applying it to selected interactive sections of the BC Form 22. This "interactive showcase" will demonstrate **Paginator's** dynamic reflow and page management with a complex, official document structure.

---

## 2. Scope & Features

### In Scope:
* **SF3.1: HTML Structure for Selected BC Form 22 Sections:**
    * Identify and create the HTML structure for 1-2 key sections of the BC Form 22 that are suitable for demonstrating dynamic content changes and pagination. (e.g., a schedule of items, an expandable notes area, a list of parties).
* **SF3.2: Paginator Integration:**
    * Apply the **Paginator** component (from EPIC-001) to the structured HTML of the BC Form 22 PoC to manage its layout and pagination.
* **SF3.3: Focused Interactivity (1-2 Key Sections):**
    * Implement JavaScript-driven interactive elements within the chosen 1-2 sections of the form. This will allow dynamic content changes (e.g., adding/removing rows in a schedule, typing text that expands a notes field) to demonstrate **Paginator's** real-time response.
    * This includes necessary client-side JavaScript application logic for the PoC's interactivity.
* **SF3.4: Visual and Print Fidelity Check:**
    * Verify that the **Paginator** accurately renders the selected sections of BC Form 22, maintaining visual integrity with the original form's layout principles where feasible.
    * Ensure that these interactive sections print correctly, reflecting their current dynamic state.

### Out of Scope (for this Epic):
* **OS3.1:** Replicating the *entire* BC Form 22.
* **OS3.2:** Implementing full data validation, data saving, or any backend logic for the form.
* **OS3.3:** Interactivity beyond the 1-2 selected sections chosen to showcase **Paginator**.
* **OS3.4:** Development of the core **Paginator** engine (EPIC-001) or the main `demonstration.html` testbed/docs (EPIC-002).

## 3. User Stories

**US3.1 (Developer - Brahm)**
:   As the Project Owner, I want to see the **Paginator** component successfully applied to a real-world legal form structure (BC Form 22) to validate its core value proposition.

**US3.2 (Developer - Brahm)**
:   As the Project Owner, I want to interact with 1-2 key sections of the BC Form 22 PoC (e.g., by adding items to a list or typing in an expandable field) and see the **Paginator** dynamically adjust the layout and page count in real-time.

**US3.3 (Developer - using Paginator)**
:   As a developer considering using **Paginator**, I want to see a PoC like the BC Form 22 showcase to understand how **Paginator** handles complex layouts and dynamic content in a practical application.

---

## 4. Technical Considerations

* The PoC will be a client-side HTML/CSS/JS implementation.
* JS for PoC interactivity should be specific to this showcase.
* Selection of appropriate sections from BC Form 22 is key to effectively demonstrating **Paginator's** strengths without excessive development effort on form replication.
* Focus is on demonstrating **Paginator**, not on perfect replication of every visual nuance of the PDF form if it doesn't serve that purpose.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

**AC3.1**
:   HTML structure for 1-2 selected sections of BC Form 22 is created.

**AC3.2**
:   The **Paginator** component is successfully integrated to manage the layout and pagination of these selected sections.

**AC3.3**
:   JavaScript-driven interactivity is implemented in the chosen 1-2 sections, allowing for dynamic content changes.

**AC3.4**
:   The **Paginator** component demonstrates accurate real-time recalculation of layout and page count in these sections of the BC Form 22 PoC in response to the interactive content changes.

**AC3.5**
:   The selected sections of the BC Form 22 PoC are visually coherent and their print output (reflecting current dynamic state) is clean.

## 6. Dependencies
* PRD (`prd.md`)
* Successful completion and stability of EPIC-001 (**Paginator** Engine).
* Insights from EPIC-002 (`demonstration.html`) development may inform PoC implementation.
