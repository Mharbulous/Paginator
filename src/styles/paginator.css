 *
 * Paginator Component CSS Master Import File
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for all Paginator-related styles.
 * It imports a set of modular CSS files, each responsible for a specific
 * aspect of the Paginator's layout, appearance, and print behavior.
 *
 * The division logic for the sub-files is as follows:
 *
 * 1.  base.css:
 * - Contains foundational, global styles and variables:
 * - All CSS Custom Properties (variables) defined in the :root selector.
 * - Basic <body> styles for the overall document.
 * - Styles for the main .paginator container.
 * - Common positioning rules for all three layers (.pgntr-paper-layer,
 * .pgntr-ink-layer, .pgntr-console-layer) that share a base absolute positioning.
 * - Debugging outline styles (.pgntr-debug-outline).
 *
 * 2.  paper.css:
 * - Styles specifically for the visual "paper" layer (.pgntr-paper-layer)
 * and the individual visual page cards (.pgntr-page-card) that appear
 * on screen only to simulate physical pages.
 * - This file focuses on the aesthetic and layout of the paper backdrop.
 *
 * 3.  ink.css:
 * - Styles for the ".pgntr-ink-layer", which is where the main document
 * content (the "ink") resides. This content is visible both on screen
 * and in print.
 * - Includes styles for common content elements like 'code' within the ink layer.
 *
 * 4.  console.css:
 * - Styles for the ".pgntr-console-layer", which is the top layer
 * intended for interactive UI controls (like buttons, menus). This layer
 * is visible on screen only.
 * - It uses 'position: fixed' to overlay controls, overriding the base
 * absolute positioning from base.css.
 *
 * 5.  screen-only.css:
 * - Contains the core rules for the ".screen-only" utility class.
 * - Ensures elements with this class are visible on screen but explicitly hidden
 * when the document is prepared for printing via @media print rules.
 *
 * 6.  print-only.css:
 * - Contains the core rules for the ".pgntr-print-only" utility class.
 * - Ensures elements with this class are hidden on screen but explicitly visible
 * only when the document is prepared for printing via @media print rules.
 *
 * 7.  print.css:
 * - Houses all general "@media print" rules.
 * - These rules transform the on-screen layout into a clean, print-ready format.
 * - Includes @page rules for print margins/size, and overrides/hides elements
 * (like the .pgntr-console-layer, .pgntr-paper-layer, and .screen-only elements)
 * that should not appear in the final printed output.
 *
 * The import order ensures that foundational styles are loaded first, followed by
 * layer-specific styles, and finally, utility classes and print-specific overrides.
