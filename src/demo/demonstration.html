                <h1>Paginator Library Usage</h1>
                <p>This document serves two purposes:  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demonstrate the paginator library in action; and</li>
                        <li>Instruct on how to use the Paginator how to use the Paginator library.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                <h2>1. Setting up Paginator Classes and Properties</h2>
                <p>The Paginator library uses a layered approach with specific CSS classes and properties to control content flow and appearance across pages.</p>
            
                <h3>Core Layers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Paper Layer (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-paper-layer</code>)</strong>:
                    This class is typically applied to the main container that represents a "page" or a printable area. It defines the overall dimensions, page-insets, and background for each page.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="pgntr-paper-layer"&gt;<br>
                    &lt;!-- Page content goes here --&gt; <br>
                    &lt;/div&gt;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ink Layer (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-ink-layer</code>)</strong>:
                    This class is applied to content within the paper layer. It often defines padding and other styles that affect the "ink" (content) area within the page page-insets.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="pgntr-paper-layer"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Console Layer (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-console-layer</code>)</strong>:
                    This layer is typically used for elements that should appear outside the main paginated content, often for debugging or meta-information. Its exact styling and purpose depend on the specific implementation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Key Properties and Classes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breakable Property (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-breakable</code>)</strong>:
                    Apply this class to elements that are allowed to break across page boundaries. The Paginator engine will attempt to break these elements if they exceed the available space on a page.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="pgntr-breakable"&gt;<br>
                    This content can be split across pages.<br>
                    &lt;/div&gt;<br></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Print Property (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-print-only</code>)</strong>:
                    Elements with this class will only be visible when the document is printed (or in print preview mode). They are hidden in screen view.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p class="pgntr-print-only"&gt;This text only appears on printed pages.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Screen Only Property (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-screen-only</code>)</strong>:
                    Elements with this class will only be visible when viewed on a screen (e.g., in a web browser). They are hidden when the document is printed.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button class="pgntr-screen-only"&gt;Print Document&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Page Break Spacer (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-page-break-spacer</code>)</strong>:
                    This class is used internally by the Paginator engine to insert visual or structural spacing where page breaks occur. By default, it's designed to be non-visible, but <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code> can be used to visualize it.
                    <p>Example (inserted by Paginator.js):</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="pgntr-page-break-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>By combining these classes and understanding their purpose, you can effectively structure your HTML content for pagination using the Paginator library.</p>
            
                <h2>2. Using <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code></h2>
                <p>The <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code> file is a utility stylesheet designed to help visualize the internal workings of the Paginator library, specifically the <code class="language-html">pgntr-page-break-spacer</code> elements.</p>
                <p><strong>To activate debugging visuals:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ensure <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code> is present in the <code class="language-html">library/styles/</code> directory.</li>
                    <li>Link this stylesheet in your HTML file's <code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;</code> section. For example, if your HTML file is in <code class="language-html">src/demo/</code>, the path would be:
                    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../../library/styles/pgntr-debug.css"&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>When <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code> is imported, elements with the class <code class="language-html">pgntr-page-break-spacer</code> will have a visible dashed red border, a light red background, and a minimum height, making them easy to identify and inspect during development.</p>
                <p><strong>To deactivate debugging visuals:</strong></p>
                <p>Simply remove or comment out the <code class="language-html">&lt;link&gt;</code> tag for <code class="language-html">pgntr-debug.css</code> from your HTML file. The <code class="language-html">pgntr-page-break-spacer</code> elements will revert to their default, non-visible state as defined by the core Paginator styles.</p>
                <h1>The Art of Skeuomorphic Design</h1>
                <p>This content resides on the <code class="language-html">.pgntr-ink-layer</code>. The page insets (<code class="language-html">--pgntr-page-inset</code>) are applied as padding to this ink layer, defining the actual readable area. The <code class="language-html">.pgntr-paper-layer</code> beneath simply displays the visual "pages" (<code class="language-html">.pgntr-page-card</code> elements) and does not contain this text. The entire document now scrolls with a single scrollbar on the body.</p>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">Skeuomorphism, in user interface design, is a concept where interface objects mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for deleting files, which visually resembles a physical trash can. This approach aims to make interfaces more intuitive by leveraging users' existing knowledge of physical objects.</p>
                
                <h2>The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again?)</h2>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">Early digital interfaces heavily relied on skeuomorphism. Think of early calendar applications that looked like desk blotters, or note-taking apps with yellow lined "paper" and handwritten fonts. This helped users transition from analog to digital tools. However, as users became more digitally literate and design trends shifted towards minimalism, skeuomorphism fell out of favor, often criticized for being cluttered or inauthentic to the digital medium. Flat design and material design, with their emphasis on clean lines and abstract representations, became dominant.</p>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">Interestingly, subtle skeuomorphic cues are making a comeback, often termed "neumorphism" or "soft UI." These designs use soft shadows and highlights to give interface elements a sense of physicality, as if they are extruding from or pressed into the background, without strictly imitating real-world objects. It's a nod to the tactile satisfaction that skeuomorphism once offered, but with a more modern, refined aesthetic.</p>
                
                <h2>Considerations for Modern Application</h2>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">When considering skeuomorphism today, designers must balance familiarity with functionality and aesthetics. Overly literal imitations can feel dated or inefficient. However, thoughtful skeuomorphic elements can still enhance usability, provide affordances (visual cues about how an object can be used), and add a touch of personality or delight to an interface. The key is intentionality and ensuring that the design choice serves a clear purpose in improving the user experience rather than being purely decorative.</p>
                
                                <h2>Further Musings on Digital Texture</h2>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">The debate between skeuomorphism and flat design often overlooks the user's cognitive load. While flat design can be sleek, it sometimes removes too many visual cues, making it harder for users to understand interactive elements. A hybrid approach, where skeuomorphic principles are applied judiciously to highlight interactivity or create a specific mood, can be very effective. For instance, a button that slightly depresses when clicked provides immediate visual feedback that is inherently skeuomorphic.</p>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">The Paginator component itself, by aiming to simulate physical paper with distinct pages, is an exercise in skeuomorphism. It seeks to provide a familiar mental model for documents that are intended for print or require a page-by-page reading experience, even when viewed on a screen. The challenge lies in making this simulation feel natural and unobtrusive, enhancing rather than hindering the consumption of the content itself. The visual cues of "pages" should aid in navigation and context, not distract from the information presented on the "ink."</p>
                <p class="breakable placeholder-text">Ultimately, the success of any design approach, skeuomorphic or otherwise, is measured by its usability and its ability to help users achieve their goals efficiently and pleasantly. Trends will come and go, but the fundamental principles of good design—clarity, feedback, consistency, and user control—remain timeless.</p>
